## Overview
This dashboard is designed to track employee projects and their activities in real-time. It automatically captures updates from connected repositories and allows manual status updates.

## Key Features

- **Profile**: Personal information and settings
- **Manual Updates**: Add custom updates, meeting notes, milestones

### For Superadmin/Managers:
- **Employee List**: View all employees and filter by department
- **Employee Details**: Click on any employee to see:
  - All projects they're assigned to
  - Recent commits and updates
  - Activity timeline
  - Performance metrics

## Database Setup

### Step 1: Run the Updated SQL Scripts

Go to your Supabase SQL Editor and run the updated scripts:

1. **001_create_tables.sql** - Creates:
   - `profiles` (employees with role: EMPLOYEE, MANAGER, SUPERADMIN)
   - `projects` (company projects)
   - `project_members` (who works on what)
   - `project_updates` (manual + auto-synced updates)
   - `project_commits` (git commits)
   - `webhooks` (for GitHub/GitLab integration)
   - `notifications`

2. **002_create_rls_policies.sql** - Security policies
3. **003_create_triggers.sql** - Auto-create profiles

### Step 2: Set Up Webhooks (Optional but Recommended)

#### GitHub Integration:
1. Go to your GitHub repository â†’ Settings â†’ Webhooks
2. Add webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/github`
3. Select events: Push, Pull Request
4. Copy the webhook secret

#### GitLab Integration:
1. Go to Settings â†’ Webhooks
2. URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/gitlab`
3. Select: Push events, Tag push events

## Next Steps to Complete

### 1. Create Webhook Endpoints
Create files:
- `app/api/webhooks/github/route.ts`
- `app/api/webhooks/gitlab/route.ts`

These will automatically create entries in `project_commits` and `project_updates`.

### 2. Update Superadmin Dashboard
Modify `/dashboard/page.tsx` to show:
- Employee list
- Project overview
- Recent activity across all projects

### 3. Create "Add Update" Form
Create `app/dashboard/user/activity/new/page.tsx` with form to manually add updates.

### 4. Set Up Real-time Subscriptions
Use Supabase Realtime to auto-refresh when new commits/updates arrive.

## Database Structure

```
profiles (employees)
  â”œâ”€â”€ project_members (assignments)
  â”‚     â””â”€â”€ projects
  â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ project_updates (manual + auto)
  â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ project_commits (git commits)
  â”‚           â””â”€â”€ webhooks (integrations)
  â””â”€â”€ notifications
```

## Current Progress

âœ… Database schema updated
âœ… Employee sidebar updated  
âœ… Employee projects page created
âœ… Employee activity page created
âœ… User role changed from USER to EMPLOYEE
âœ… Removed unnecessary features (API keys, export)

ðŸ”„ To Do:
- Create webhook endpoints
- Update superadmin dashboard
- Add manual update form
- Set up real-time sync
- Add employee filtering/search

## Running the App

1. Make sure Supabase is configured in `.env.local`
2. Run SQL scripts in Supabase
3. Start dev server: `pnpm dev`
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
5. Sign up as employee â†’ Gets redirected to `/dashboard/user`

## Making Someone a Superadmin

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'SUPERADMIN' 
WHERE email = 'your-email@company.com';
```

Then that user can access `/dashboard` (admin view).
